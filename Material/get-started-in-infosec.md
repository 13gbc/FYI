- Understand OWASP top 10 project and Sans top 25 projects and their detailed understanding
- Different classes of attacks (e.g., passive, active, insider, close-in, distribution, etc.) 
- Different operational-threat environments (e.g., first generation (script kiddies), second generation (non-nation state sponsored), and third generation (nation state sponsored))
- General attack stages (e.g., footprinting and scanning, enumeration, gaining access, escalation of privileges, maintaining access, network exploitation, covering tracks, etc.)
- Traffic flows across the network (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), Open System Interconnection Model (OSI), Information Technology
- Infrastructure Library, v3 (ITIL))
- IA principles and organizational requirements (relevant to confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, nonrepudiation)
- Network access, identity, and access management (e.g., public key infrastructure, PKI)
- Network protocols such as TCP/IP, Dynamic Host Configuration, Domain Name System (DNS), and directory services
- Network security architecture concepts including topology, protocols, components, and principles (e.g., application of defense-in-depth)
- Penetration testing principles, tools, and techniques (e.g., metasploit, burpsuite, etc.)
- Programming language syntax (bash, python, php, asp.net)
- Relevant laws, policies, procedures, or governance as they relate to work that may impact critical infrastructure
- System and application security threats and vulnerabilities System and application security threats and vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflow, mobile code, cross-site scripting, PL/SQL and injections, race conditions, covert channel, replay, return-oriented attacks, and malicious code)
- What constitutes a network attack and the relationship to both threats and vulnerabilities
