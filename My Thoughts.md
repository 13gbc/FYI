+ **My own thoughts:**<br/>
  + I wonder why we share domain name IoCs? The moment they are published in OSINT, wouldn't those malware authors be tracking it? They will instantly change their C2s with different names. Maybe even automated changes for them!! Imagine someone who has the potential to create deadly malware. Wouldn't it be very easy for them to track and change their C2s instantly as soon as they are published on the Internet by AV/EDR/other product based companies? It is not that we shouldn't share, but how much will it be actually helpful in real-time for others?
